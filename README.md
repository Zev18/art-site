# Art website

I created this website to showcase my art, which has been a longtime hobby of mine. This is actually a replacement of an older website, which was actually the first website I ever created with raw HTML and CSS. That site was not very responsive and a pain in the butt to update, which made me want to make a new website, one that looked better on mobile and was easy to update.

### Technology

For this project, I used:
- Next.js for the Javascript framework
- Vercel for hosting
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for image hosting
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) for the image carousel
- TailwindCSS & HeadlessUI for styling and some components

### Running locally

To run this website locally, download the code. Then in the terminal:

`bun dev`

or

`npm run dev`

will run the project on port 3000.
